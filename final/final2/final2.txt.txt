THE LCD: it will be connected on port d as shown in the attached image

THE  KEYPAD: it will be connected on port c as shown in the attached image, for each row each column is checked 
in order to find which key is pressed on the keypad ( * and # won;t be accepted as each one has its own register
for approval or disapproval as the system checks the entered string subtracts it from those registers and if the outcome was
zero in any one of them it gives the error message on the LCD).

THE LED: it will be off at first, the when the program starts it lights up as the door is unlocked.

THE PASSCODE: it will be initialized in the code as 1234, and it will be stored in an array, as each character ofa number takes a place when a used enters the string via the
keypad it will be displayed on the LCD, each entered number will be multiplied by 10 then added 
to the next number, until the user presses on the button.


BUTTON PRESS: (this will work as an interrupt on RB0) when the button is pressed the system checks if the stored number is equal to the saved
password by sending the number to W and subtracting it from the password value for each character stored in the array, if W had zero in it, 
that will mean that the password is correct as the message "safe  is locked" with the led color turns off,
else if the value wasn't zero the LCD will display "Wrong code!" and restarts the process.
