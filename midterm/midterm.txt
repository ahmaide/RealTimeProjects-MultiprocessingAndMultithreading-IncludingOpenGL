THE HOTEL PROCESS
===================================================================
The hotel process contains the following threads:
    1- TOURISTS GENERATION THREAD: that generates groups of tourists by the given frequency per time and each group will
       have its own struct that describes it, and a vector will save each tourist group by their current state (pre-reserved,
       waiting, in a room).

    2- RECEPTION EMPLOYEE THREADS BY THE NUMBER OF GIVEN EMPLOYEES: in order for each thread to access the coming tourist
       group, a mutex is locked in order for the reception to hold a tourist group then unlock the mutex as no more than
       one employee can access the available groups, when an employee captures a group his next job is to reserve a room
       for them by order, or give them a turn in case of no rooms are available.

    3- BELLBOYS THREADS BY THE NUMBER OF GIVEN BELLBOYS: this threads keeps checking for available bags to send to rooms
       when the bellboy find a bag it keeps looking for a second bag for the same room in cases if he finds or doesn't find
       a second bag he'll go to the room that is given to the group who owns the bag or two bags, in order to check the
       available bags the bellboy will lock a mutex and then releases it after finishes checking or finds two bag, the bellyboy
        takes a time between the min and max times that are given to him and then a number is generated to see how happy the
        bellboy is between the max and min numbers for his PSYCHOLOGICAL_STATE if it was above or below the needed psychological
        state to get tipped, the same thing will be done when taking the luggage back down.

    4- KITCHEN EMPLOYEE THREADS BY THE GIVEN NUMBER: each one of those threads will take a step turn in order to make a
     meal when a tourist group makes a food order, each step takes a time between the given mix and min times

     5- MAINTENANCE THREADS BY THE GIVEN NUMBER: these threads will keep checking if there is a request for having to fix
      something when a request is available, the maintenance employee will be absent for a time between the min and max
      defined time

      6- UNSATISFIED_CHECKER: this thread checks the unsatisfied tourists by checking a shared memory between the hotel
         process and the tourist groups processes in order to remove a process from the hotel.
